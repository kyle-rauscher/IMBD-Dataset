# IMBD-Dataset

This project looks to combine all of our datasets and multiple datasources into a singular file and then run some exploritory data analysis based on the cleaned dataset.

The data comes from a couple of various data sources. The first comes from an initial Kaggle Dataset, which contained a list of movies that were on various platforms. The other dataset comes from data IMDB itself and their publically avaliable database of listed movies.

If you have any issues running the code, please contect krausche@lion.lmu.edu.
